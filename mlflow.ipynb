    "Data Scientist leverages MLFlow for :\n",
    "1. Experiment Tracking and Hypothesis Testing(EDA,FE,Model Training , Model Validation)-> EDA(Statistical Analysis needs to be performed->i.e hypothesis testing needs to be done(multiple statistial analysis needs to be done based on the data , problem statement that we have)->for each and every statistical analysis we will try to perform experiment tracking , to track each and every details in such a way that we understand tracking is happening in efficient way with versioning considering in place)  --> This is where MLFlow as an MLOPs platform will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Code Structuring : We create a pipeline(w.r.t EDA,FE,Model Training and Model Validation) -> With MLFlow this pipeline creation and code structuring  will be much better when compared to the previous way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Packaging and Dependency Management: When we create and end to end project we create some files like setup.py files , with setup.py files we package our entire application along with the dependencies that we specifically have.\n",

    "4. Evaluating Hyperparameter Tuning: (Strongest Feature of MLFLOW) Let's say i will train a specific model, -> Training a model i have lot of parameters which i can use -> To use multiple parameters efficiently i will be using hyperparameter tuning . What mlflow does is that , it helps u to track the hyperparameter tuning w.r.t every parameter(every combination)-> This tracking we can see in form of visualization graph.\n",

    "5. Can Compare Results of Models Retraining over time(since versioning,experimenting basically is happening): By this we will be able to select most optimal model for deployment."
